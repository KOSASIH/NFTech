# NFTech

Neurofibromatosis prevention medical technology system supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Mission

1. NFTech is a medical technology company providing the only preventive treatment for Neurofibromatosis (NF), a genetic disease that causes brain tumors, eye problems and other health defects. NFTech's electroceutical approach uses patient's own.

2. To alleviate the pain and suffering of patients with Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) by developing a technology using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict the course of this debilitating disorder.

3. To design and develop neurofibroma medical information management interactive AI diagnostic system.

4. NFTech® is a medical technology portfolio including medical devices, software and data analytics products focused on neurofibromatosis (NF) and other rare disorders. Our products are designed to improve the lives of people living with NF as well as

5. NFTech is a medical technology company that helps reduce the number of new neurofibromatosis cases by providing its patented screening technologies for early detection of NF1.

#### Description

NFTech is a comprehensive, risk-focused medical technology platform for the early detection of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (craniopharyngiomas and neurofibromas) in children — also known as Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The NFTech AI/ML algorithms are trained on more than 100 clinical features derived from MRIs, CTs, PET scans and genetic data. They automatically flag subtle signs of these tumors, which can be difficult for clinicians to identify on their own due to their small size and unique location in the brain.

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that can cause tumors to grow on nervous system tissue.

It can affect people of all ages, but it is most common in children. Neurofibromatosis can cause learning disabilities, vision loss, and hearing problems.

It is caused by a mutation in the gene that makes a protein called neurofibromin. The mutation causes too much neurofibromin to be made, which leads to too many tumors growing on nerves.

There is currently no cure for neurofibromatosis; however, doctors can treat symptoms when they are found early enough. There are two types of treatment: surgery or radiation therapy to remove tumors or prevent them from growing larger.

The NeuroFibroScan system uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help identify patients at risk for neurofibromatosis so they can be treated as early as possible and avoid serious complications later in life.

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic condition that can cause tumors in the skin, nervous system, and other parts of the body. The disease can be life-threatening if left untreated.

The NFTech prevention system is a medical technology platform supported by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms. It uses a combination of data from brain scans, blood tests, and genetic analyses to provide personalized recommendations for at-risk patients. The system allows physicians to identify patients who need to be screened for neurofibromatosis before symptoms have manifested themselves. The technology can also help physicians monitor treatment progress and prevent future complications from occurring when appropriate action is taken early enough in the course of treatment.

Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerve tissue. This disease can be life-threatening, and it affects about 1 in every 3,000 people in the United States.

For those who suffer from neurofibromatosis, treatment is usually difficult and expensive.

But what if we told you that there was a new medical technology system that could help prevent this disease from occurring at all?

That's [NFTech], a company that has developed a medical technology system supported by artificial intelligence to help prevent neurofibromatosis.

#### Value Proposition

NFTech develops Neurofibromatosis prevention medical technology system supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI): Our project is a platform capable of providing a preventive, personalized disease management program, which will help manage the whole NF1 patient's life with NFD symptom prediction and medical AI-based medical decision support.
